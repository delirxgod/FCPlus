## What is?
----------------------------------------
This is an extension for the FASTCUP.NET project created to change the color palette (theme). Also auto-acceptance of the match and much more.

## Updates :skull:
----------------------------------------
At the moment, I am just learning to write code and I am also still a student, so how will the time be - there will be updates. The goals are quite extensive and quite heavy for me to implement, so updates can drag on a little.

## Why? :woozy_face:
----------------------------------------
Having played a certain number of matches, I was a little tired of the color palette, I wanted something new. Also, from time to time, tools were needed as auto-accept in order to move away from the workplace and, for example, make tea.

## How to install? :hear_no_evil:
----------------------------------------
To install the extension, you need to:
1. Download the latest release from the [repository](https://github.com/delirxgod/FCPlus/releases).
2. Open browser extensions (URL:  `chrome ://extensions/` ).
3. Unpack the file and drag it into the browser window. Then click the \*add\* button.

Have fun. Is there a question or an idea? Write to [me](https://vk.com/d3lir)
